Here is the root of android tracer.

We are creating a tool that trace the user perceived performance of 
android app and android phone itself.

We follow a simple way to indentify the user perceived performance
(Might not be accurate), which caculate the time interval of a user 
input event (Touch, Drag, Click...) to a first UI update event. 

By inserting code into linux kernel, android framework, we could capture
the time user start a input event and the time android phone start a
ui update event.
  Also we capture kernel events to understand what is happening inside 
system.

Please read the paper from panappticon on 
wiki.yangqi.info/LinuxKernel
