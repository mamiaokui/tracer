To compute the dependency between events and construct the transaction graph, run:
  cat <sorted event stream that contains both kernel log and user log> | python ComputeDependencies.py 

Each connected subgraph would be stored as a pickle file in the ./result. To read it or check out the file, use
DebugUtil.py or PrintTransaction.py.

To do resource accounting, use ResourceCounting.py.
